# Brewstr Mobile Application - Android

Brewstr Mobile-Based Community Application

This application is built for the Brewstr Automated Hombrewing machine. It acts to interface with the Brewstr machine, to provide recipe configuration,
brew process setpoints, and also recieve live data logging internal conditions from the machine. As we are in our prototyping phase, the layouts 
haven't been tastefully developed. The important parts are the serial data communications, and user input.

Development Environment: Android Studio V0.9.9 Arduino IDE (arduino UNO)
